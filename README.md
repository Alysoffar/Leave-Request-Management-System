This is a leave request management system project where the employee can request a leave, each employee have a leave balance and a designated manager,
by which the leave balance is calculated based on the amount of days he requested and if the amount is not over his leave balance,
the request is send to his manager to either accept or reject the leave.
If the employee does not have a designated manager the leave is automatically accepted if he have enough leave balance.
